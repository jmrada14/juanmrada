# Ground-Up

An application to keep track of US representatives.

## Technologies Used:

Initially Ground-up was built using the MERN Stack but I rebuilt it using NextJS and MongoDB

## Intro:

We wanted to know who each congressman and congresswoman was, from both chambers of congress (the House of Representatives and the Senate.) Thankfully, ProPublica has a data-store, and from it we were able to access all current members of congress(and much more)
