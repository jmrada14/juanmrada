# The Crypto Utopia

Let's talk about cryptocurrencies and why its narrative is incoherent. At their core cryptocurrencies are nothing more than pyramid scheme "investments" masquerading as new tech.

Are cryptocurrencies an investment or a currency? These two are complete opposites.
An investment generates what is called a return. I.E., You buy XYZ for $5,000, wait for some time, then sell for $10,000 and make a 50% return on your investment.
On the other hand, currencies need to be stable relative to the goods and services you plan to buy in an economy. I.E., If I get an omakase today for $30, I expect to buy the same omakase tomorrow without variations in price. My hope is that price won't vary drastically over short periods of time.

Currencies need to be stable. If the value of a currency fluctuates much then all merchants, customers, and financial entities have a big problem.

#### So... is it a currency or an investment?

We can't run an economy in an hyper-volatile medium of exchange. If the price goes up and down every day, the increase is **only** a good thing if it is an investment. This completely destroys the argument for crypto being a currency.

#### Is it an investment then?

Nope. There is no fundamental reason a token is worth anything. There is no rational valuation method. No ties to economic activities.

#### WHAT IS IT THEN??

Predatory speculative investments.

A "greater fool" investment. What does that mean?
Let's describe the buying behavior of people who have crypto assets. They buy from an exchange service like Coinbase, hold the tokens in hopes of the number growing so they can redeem their fiat currency. Since there is no utility or cashflow from these tokens, the only way of making money from this scheme is for the exchange to find someone who will buy the tokens from you for more than you paid. This is a horrible form of investment because unlike many other financial tokens such as stocks, bonds, or even real estate, there is no fundamental reason why the tokens should be worth more or less tomorrow.
The basic math on a greater fool investment is that every one winner is necessarily paid out by multiple losers.

Remember there is not an infinite supply of greater fools, and when you run out of fools... the scheme collapses.

## Pros and cons of crypto

### Pros:

-   Make some rich people richer (?)

### Cons:

-   Bad for the environment
-   Speculation
-   Perfect for crime
-   Volatility
-   Taking advantage of unaware investors

## Cryptocurrencies use cases:

-   Cybercrime
-   Gambling and speculation
-   Replacing the financial system with "decentralization" shitfuckery. AKA no customer service, lack of accountability, no legal entity assuming liability.

## Faith, belief, and fanaticism

Purchasing a crypto token is an entry in an accounting database, an extremely expensive collection of bits. Its value is purely speculative. Like a religion, it is a system of belief backed by wishful and irrational thinking and a combination of fear and greed.
